	<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is <strong>Jonah</strong> but normally on the internet I go by <strong>Binary Idiot</strong>.
Although I am just starting out in the world of computer programming, I am incredibly passionate about what I do.
When I am not working on one of my various projects, I am learning something new in the fascinating world of science and technology.
In addition to my many computer related pursuits, I am also an avid pc gamer, and an amature science fiction author.</p>
<p>After all this you may be thinking <em>Wow, he sounds like quite a geek</em> and honestly thats just the way I like it!</p>
