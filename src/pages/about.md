## About Me

Hello, my name is **Jonah** but normally on the internet I go by **Binary Idiot**.
Although I am just starting out in the world of computer programming, I am incredibly passionate about what I do.
When I am not working on one of my various projects, I am learning something new in the fascinating world of science and technology.
In addition to my many computer related pursuits, I am also an avid pc gamer, and an amature science fiction author.

After all this you may be thinking _Wow, he sounds like quite a geek_ and honestly thats just the way I like it!
